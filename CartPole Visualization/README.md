# CartPole Visualization

This directory contains the code necessary for visualizing your CartPole agent in action.

Please follow the steps below to get started:

1. Create a local copy of this repository (by cloning it via GitHub Desktop / [Git](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone), or by [downloading it as a `.ZIP` file](https://github.com/Harrow-Enigma/ai-lecture-series-summer21/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)).

2. Install the Python packages `numpy`, `gym`, `tensorflow`. The simplest way to do this is is via *pip*. Run the following command in your terminal:
   
   `pip install numpy gym tensorflow`
   
   You might need to opt for `pip3` if your system has multiple Python installations.

3. Navigate into the `CartPole Visualization` directory, and replace the sample `weights.h5` file with your own trained weights.

   Please keep the filename the same.
   
4. Run `cartpole.py`.
